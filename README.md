**Name:** Elizabeth Trotter

**Project Note:** This project is a play on the popular `Rock, Paper, Scissors Game` utilizing `JavaScript`. I approached this project with the intention of creating a `Single Page Application`. On start, the application will load a `single HTML page` and `dynamically update the content` as users interact with the it, reducing the need to reload the entire page. My goal was to practice my JavaScript skills related to `creating elements` and making necessary changes within a single game container. 


***Key Game Requirements:***
- *PvP and PvCPU*
- *Different modes: 1 win / 3 out of 5 / 4 out of 7*
- *Show the rules of the game*


## Peer Review

> **Comment(s):** The design is very clean. Both the CPU and player vs player mode are functional. I think the patterns at the bottom and the solid icons are a nice addition as well. The only problem I can find is when I restart the game, the page takes a while to load up. Overall good job.

**Issues Resolved:**
- Added "Loading..." text to signify to user that the game is restarting and the button click was confirmed :white_check_mark: *1/19/24 2:20 pm*
